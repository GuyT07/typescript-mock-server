# Typescript mock server
Simple mock server that can be used in front end development. Instead of creating json files you can just publish TypeScript objects as json. 
This makes it easier to maintain your mocks because you can load your own models. When you change your implementation you also 
have to update your mock, otherwise you will receive compile errors.
